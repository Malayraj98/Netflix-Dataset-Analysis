Context
Netflix has a quantity-over-quality problem. This is part of an effort to help solve this. I was trying to figure out a way to find hidden gems in their catalog but found it exceedingly hard to get the latest dataset that has ratings and many other attributes to help make sense of it. To help me and others dig deep into the latest Netflix content, I created this dataset. This is the same dataset that powers FlixGem.com, the aforementioned side project.

Content
This dataset combines data sources from Netflix, Rotten Tomatoes, IMBD, posters, box office information, trailers on YouTube, and more using a variety of APIs. Note that there is no official Netflix API.

I also added a unique metric called "Hidden Gem Score", which I calculated using low review count and high rating. Lower the review count and higher the user rating, higher the hidden gem score.

Freshness
Recent Netflix data is incredibly hard to come up. This dataset is updated every month. This was lasted updated in early April 2021.
